# React Authentication Example

This is an example application I created to showcase how to implement authentication on a web application using React and react-router on the frontend and node.js, express, mongodb, and mongoose on the backend.

The [associated blog post](https://medium.com/@faizanv/authentication-for-your-react-and-express-application-w-json-web-tokens-923515826e0) for this example can be found [here](https://medium.com/@faizanv/authentication-for-your-react-and-express-application-w-json-web-tokens-923515826e0).

To run the application first clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/faizanv/react-auth-example.git
```

Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```
Make sure that MongoDB is running
```
mongod
```
run the server
```
npm run server
```
and then in a separate window/tab run the frontend
```
npm start
```
The application should be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
